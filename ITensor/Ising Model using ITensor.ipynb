    "# Ising Model using ITensor (Julia)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a personal notebook for myself, though hopefully it also helps others understand how some functions in ITensors work.\n",
    "This is basically an editted notebook that uses the following link: itensor.org/docs.cgi?vers=julia&page=formulas/mixed_sites_dmrg\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider an ising model with $N$ sites. The Hamiltonian for the ising model is given as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = -J\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \\sigma^z_{j} \\sigma^z_{j+1} - h \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sigma^x_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first sum is a two-body operator and the sum ends at $N-2$. This makes it so that the final pair is operating on sites $N-2, N-1$. The second term is a one-body operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",

    "$N$ is the number of sites.\n",

    "In the code cell below, we start by defining our three parameters. Next, we create our array of N spins. In the 'let' statement, we start by creating a collection of matrix product operator. Then, in the for loop, we iterate from $j=1$ to $N-1$ and to our MPO we add $\\sigma^x_j$ and $\\sigma^z_j\\sigma^z_{j+1}$ operators with the given strenghts. Since the for loop terminates at $j=N-1$, at the end, we include an additional operator for the $N$th site, since the for loop does not capture the final $\\sigma^x$ operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the MPO() function to take the collection of operators and turn them into a formal Matrix Product Operator, with the proper indices and labels. We can think of this step as creating the Hamiltonian. The following lines then define accuracy parameters: the number of sweeps, maximum dimensions, bond length, and cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "psi0 is a random matrix product state. This will be our initial state that we will variationally modify to find the ground state energy. \n",
