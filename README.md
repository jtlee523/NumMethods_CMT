# NumMethods_CMT
Personal repo for me to keep all of my numerical methods material and progress orgranized. 

## Intro

I had a very difficult time learning numerical methods, since I couldn't find a normalized or structured way to do so. My hope is to first collect all of my material here, but eventually organize it in a way such that undergraduate students could use it as a resource to learn numerical methods for physics. 

### Tensor Networks

My end goal is to build fluency using ITensors in Julia, but beforehand, I am looking at the following references:

1) "The density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product states" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.3477.pdf
2) European School on Tensor Networks: http://quantumtensor.pks.mpg.de/index.php/schools/
