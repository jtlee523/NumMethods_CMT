# NumMethods_CMT
Personal repo for me to keep all of my numerical methods material and progress orgranized. 

## Intro

I had a very difficult time learning numerical methods, since I couldn't find a normalized or structured way to do so. My hope is to first collect all of my material here, but eventually organize it in a way such that undergraduate students could use it as a resource to learn numerical methods for physics. 

Currently, this repo will just have notebooks of code samples. Eventually, I want to reformat it in a way so it becomes a self contained "course." But, for the time being, I will try to document my progress here!

## Intro_NumMethods_(language)

I am now trying to write these notebooks in a way so that other undergraduate students can learn the basics of numerical methods. I will be working on the Julia and Python notebooks simultaneously, but will spend much more time on the Julia notebooks since I feel that there are more available resources in Python. I hope to cover programming exersizes as well as some pseudocode to explain the algorithms. 



## Tensor Networks

My end goal is to build fluency using ITensors in Julia, but beforehand, I am looking at the following references:

1) "The density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product states" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.3477.pdf
2) European School on Tensor Networks: http://quantumtensor.pks.mpg.de/index.php/schools/

I am using Julia and ITensors, which can be found at this link: http://itensor.org/index.html


### Notebooks

Here are some of the miscellaneous notebooks I have included in my folders thus far.

-ITensor

--Ising Model example (using autoMPO() and MPO() )

--Measurements within an MPS

--Hubbard Model

-Hubbard Model

--Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian Generator
