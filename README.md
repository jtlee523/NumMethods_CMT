# NumMethods_CMT
Personal repo for me to keep all of my numerical methods material and progress orgranized. 

## Intro

I had a very difficult time learning numerical methods, since I couldn't find a normalized or structured way to do so. My hope is to first collect all of my material here, but eventually organize it in a way such that undergraduate students could use it as a resource to learn numerical methods for physics.
